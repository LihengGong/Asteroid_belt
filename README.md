# Asteroid_belt
A 3d asteroid belt using OpenGL to render [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LihengGong/Asteroid_belt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/LihengGong/Asteroid_belt)


Todos:
* Completely get rid of glm and use Eigen so that the code is clean and consistent
* Is it possible to make the rocks rotate(This might be quite challenging since sending large amount of model matrices can be a bottleneck)?
* Try more textures
